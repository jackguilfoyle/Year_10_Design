		<h3>Hill Workouts</h3>
		<p>Hill Workouts are a great option for people looking to improve both their running strength and endurance. Running up hills builds muscle strength as it requires more leg strength than aerobic strength to run up a hill. Consistantly exposing your body to this type of training improves your leg power and allowes you to have a stride which is more powerful, making running more efficant. Hill workouts also work on endurance as repeating hills builds stamina and also improves your muscles abilities to continue working out while tired.</p> 

		<ul>
			<li><p><b>Continous Hills: </b><br>Continous hills are a great option for any runner who is looking to work on both their stamina and muscle endurance when running hills. <br><b>Sutability: </b>Intermiedate and Andvanced Runners<br><br><b>The Workout: </b><br>Begin with a 10 minute warm up followed by some dynamic stretching. Here is my recommended <a href="advice.html">dynamic warm-up</a>. Find a 200m long hill with a moderate slope. One set is running four of those uphills continously with the first one being easy, second one being medium, and the final to two being hard. Between each uphill, recover the downhills with an easy jog. Between sets take 2 - 3 minutes of rest. Start out by compleating 2 sets but work you way up over time to 3 or 4 sets.</p></li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Fartlek Workouts</h3>
		<p>Fartlek workouts are a great way to build speed and endurance as you're consistantly running, while also working your speed as the fast section of these workouts are designed to be fast.</p> 

		<ul>
			<li><p><b>Pyrimid: </b><br>Pyrimids are a great fartlek workout because the work on your speed over varying distances with rest built in between those distances. Also they help you push your way up the pyrimid before increasing your speed on your way down. <br><b>Sutability: </b>All levels<br><br><b>The Workout: </b><br>Begin with a 10 minute warm up followed by some dynamic stretching. Here is my recommended <a href="advice.html">dynamic warm-up</a>. Start with One minute hard followed by 30s easy. Then 2min hard, 30s easy. 3min hard, 30s easy. 3min hard, 30s easy. 2min hard, 30s easy. And finished with 1min hard, 30s easy. That amounts to twelve minutes of hard running spread over 15min. Try to not go out to fast, but instead increse your speed throughout the workout.</p></li>
