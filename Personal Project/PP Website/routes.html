		<h3>North York</h3>
			<p><b>Sunnybrook and Wilket Creek Loop</b>
			<br>
			<b>Distance:</b> 6.5km
			<br>
			<b>Terrain:</b> Mainly asphalt, however graval through Glendon Forest
			<br>
			<b>Elevation Change:</b> Gradual uphill if compleated counter-clockwise with a steep downhill or if compleated clockwise a steep uphill with a gradual downhill.
			<br>
			This loop brings runners out of the city and into one of the city's largest parks on one of the nicest ravines. Runners can begin anywhere along the loop, however I suggest they start in the parking lot beside the dog park accessed through Sunnybrook Hospital.<br></p>

		<h3>Old Toronto</h3>
			<p><b>Yellow Creek and Moore Park Ravine Loop</b>
			<br>
			<b>Distance:</b> 7.5km
			<br>
			<b>Terrain:</b> Mainly gravel or dirt. The red section segnifies a back country trail with more cross country style terrain/
			<br>
			<b>Elevation Change:</b> Gradual but signifiant elevation change with the Brickworks being much lower than Mt. Pleasent Cemetary.
			<br>
			This loop provides runners with the feeling of ravine running where the paths are more trails and theirs less asphalt. It also is a great longer run with hills loop as it provides a great long uphill no matter which way you run it.<br></p>
